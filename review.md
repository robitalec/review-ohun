### Review Comments

#### Documentation

**A statement of need**

- TODO: compare, contrast with other options
- TODO: how does ohun integrate with other packages?


**Installation instructions**

-   Please consider including a link to the documentation for the dependency `seewave` for installing and troubleshooting system requirements. For example: <https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/inst.html>



**Vignette(s)** 

- TODO: split into multiple vignettes
- TODO: consider not blocking warnings that a user would get on their own machine

**Function Documentation** 

**Examples**

- Found errors locally using `devtools::run_examples()`


If recommendation to move `tuneR` to , the following issues can be resolved

In `feature_acoustic_data.R`:

- `could not find function "writeWave"` fixed by adding `library(tuneR)`



**Community guidelines**
